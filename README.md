# Event Ticket Booking System
A project that shows real-world implemntation of Data Structures and Algorithms.

##  Project Overview
The Event Ticket Booking System is a website inspired by real-world event booking platforms.  
It allows users to browse events and book **Normal, VIP tickets securely.

The project combines **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** with **full-stack web development** to demonstrate efficient data handling, user authentication, and booking logic.

---

##  Authentication
- Firebase Authentication is used  
- Secure **Google Sign-In** for users  
- Each booking is associated with a logged-in user  

---

##  Features
-  Login with Google (Firebase Authentication)  
-  View available events  
-  Multiple ticket types:
  - Normal  
  - VIP  
-  Ticket booking and confirmation  
-  Automatic ticket price calculation  
-  Support for private / premium tickets  
-  Efficient booking logic using DSA concepts  

---

##  Data Structures & Algorithms Used
- Arrays / Lists – Storing events and ticket data
- stack - for tickets booking
- queue - for cancelling tickets
- priority queue - for vip tickets 
 - Optimized logic for ticket availability and confirmation  

---

##  Tech Stack

### Frontend
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

### Backend
- Node.js  
- Express.js  

### Database
- MongoDB  

### Authentication
- Firebase (Google Authentication)

##  Application Workflow
1. User logs in using Google  
2. System displays available events  
3. User selects an event  
4. Ticket type is chosen (Normal / VIP)  
5. Availability is checked  
6. Ticket is confirmed  
7. Total price is calculated  
8. Booking details are stored in the database
